In this file, I'm solving the equation below, if you change the code accordingly, it can be used to solve your problem. I have placed some #### in front of the
lines that need to be changed.
𝑦′′(𝑥)+𝑝(𝑥)𝑦′(𝑥)+𝑞(𝑥)𝑦(𝑥)=𝑟(𝑥)
𝑦(𝑎)=𝛼,𝑦(𝑏)=𝛽

𝑦′′+3𝑦′−4𝑦=5𝑒^𝑥,𝑦(0)=0,𝑦(1)=𝑒^−4
real answer: 𝑦(𝑥)=𝑒^(−4𝑥)−𝑒^𝑥+𝑥𝑒^𝑥
